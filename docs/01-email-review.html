hank you for
submitting your plugin, "Donasai =E2=80=93 Platform Donasi & Penggalangan
Dana".Before your plugin reaches a human reviewer, our automated tools
=E2=80=94 which help the team handle around 1,000 plugin reviews per week
=E2=80=94 have flagged a few potential issues that you may need to address.
To avoid delays and help streamline the manual review process, we=E2=80=99v=
e
pended your submission to give you a chance to review and fix these
common issues.=F0=9F=A4=96 This is an automated message generated using a
combination of algorithms and AI. It hasn=E2=80=99t necessarily been
reviewed by a human. Its purpose is to help you resolve potential
common issues early, before manual review begins. All AI outputs are
marked with the emoji =E2=9C=A8 and it's quite accurate.Who are we?We are a
group of volunteers who help you identify common issues so that you
can make your plugin more secure, compatible, reliable and compliant
with the guidelines.For consistency and better communication, your
plugin review will be assigned to a single volunteer who will assist
you throughout the entire review. However, response times may vary
depending on how much time the volunteer is able to contribute to the
team and if whether they need to consult something with the rest of
the team.The review process

Please read this email in full and check each issue, as well as the
links to the documentation and the provided examples. Also, search for
any other similar occurrences of the same issue that are not
explicitly mentioned in the email.Make sure you understand the issues
so that you can incorporate them into your existing skillset.If you
decide to continue with the review process, you must fix any issues,
test your plugin, upload a corrected version and then reply to this
email.In case of any doubt, please fix everything else and ask your
questions alongside the update.Your plugin is manually checked by a
volunteer who sends you the remaining identified issues in the
plugin.We will be devoting our time to reviewing your plugin, we ask
that you honor this by following the instructions.Note: Volunteers are
not your QA team. They are here to help you identify and understand
issues so that you can improve and maintain your plugin in the future.
Fixing the issues is your responsibility.If there are no further
issues, the plugin will be approved =F0=9F=8E=89Be brief and direct in your
reply (please, avoid copy-pasting bloated AI responses, our AI is
quite brief), be patient and make sure you have addressed all the
issues and tested your plugin before responding.It is disheartening to
receive an updated plugin only to find that only a few issues have
been resolved, or that it causes a fatal error upon activation.When
not making adequate progress in your review, it will be delayed and
eventually rejected, for the sake of volunteers devoting their time
and other plugin authors who correctly follow the review process.Each
volunteer can review up to 300 plugins per week, and they love to have
life besides reviewing plugins, so please make things easier for
us.Understanding the Review QueueWhen you reply, your plugin enters
the review queue again. Fewer review cycles mean quicker approval,
while multiple reviews can extend the process to weeks or months.Tip:
Carefully fix all issues and test your plugin before resubmitting to
speed up approval.This process is designed to help you improve your
plugin while making the review experience faster and more efficient
for everyone.Have you read the guidelines and this plugin complies
with them?Upon submitting your plugin, you agreed and confirmed that
it complies with the WordPress.org Plugin Directory Guidelines, which
apply to all plugins in the directory.Our automated tools have
detected patterns that may require a closer look regarding compliance
with certain guidelines. We will verify this during our manual review,
but it=E2=80=99s best to address any potential issues beforehand. In
particular, please pay attention to the following:Any included code
must be GPL-compatible. This means, among others, that the users have
to receive the four essential freedoms: (0) to run the program, (1) to
study and change the program in source code form, (2) to redistribute
exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions. (Guidelines 1 &
4)Developers must provide public, maintained access to their source
code and any build tools in one of the following ways: (1) Include the
source code in the deployed plugin, (2) A link in the readme to the
development location. (Guidelines 1, 4)Plugins must not restrict or
lock functionality. (Guidelines 1, 5, & 9 =E2=80=94 see clarification on
SaaS in Guideline 6)Your plugin may not embed external links or
credits on the public site without explicit user permission.
(Guideline 10)Please check it, and if you think everything is fine, do
not worry. Our tools are very thorough and may highlight different
things as potential issues.Are you the rightful owner of this
plugin?We know this might seem like an odd question =E2=80=94 especially
coming from an algorithm =E2=80=94 but bear with us; it=E2=80=99ll all make=
 sense
soon.Here's how it works: If your plugin uses a name or URL associated
with a specific entity, we need to confirm that you actually represent
that entity. It's that simple.So, how do we verify your identity? In
most cases, we rely on the domain in your email address.This situation
usually comes up if you're using a personal account to submit a plugin
meant to represent a company or if you=E2=80=99re a third party attempting
to upload a plugin on someone else=E2=80=99s behalf (please don=E2=80=99t d=
o
that).This is what we know about this plugin:Plugin name: "Donasai -

Your email domain "gmail.com" does not seem to be related to any of

identification towards clarifying ownership, even if it contains your
or your company's name. Anyone can create any gmail.com account that
is not already in use. You could be you, but you could also be anyone
else.Please note that we carry out these checks to protect people like
you. If someone else submitted a plugin under your name or your
company's name, you would rightly be upset if we failed to confirm
ownership in a demonstrably reliable way.=E2=98=91=EF=B8=8F You can demonst=
rate or
clarify ownership in one of the following ways:=F0=9F=93=A9 Update your
WordPress.org email address to one under the domain of the entity
associated with the plugin. You can change it in Your WordPress.org
profile, we cannot change it for you.Note: We will continue the review
in this email thread. Any new emails will be sent to the new email
account.=F0=9F=91=A4 Reply asking us to transfer this submission to the

owner does not yet have an account, they can create it using an email
that is under the domain of the entity associated to the plugin.=E2=9A=A0=
=EF=B8=8F
Do not resubmit this plugin using the new account. I will transfer it
for you. Simply reply to this email with the new username.Note: Once
the plugin has been approved, you can ask the owner to add you as a
committer in the "Advanced" section of the plugin, so that you can
commit code using your account.=F0=9F=9B=A0 Change the plugin=E2=80=99s dis=

change the slug via the "Add your plugin" page.Reply to this email
clarifying the situation, we know that sometimes you might be using an
email account that belongs to the same entity or an entity that owns
the other entity. Also, if you already have established plugins in the
directory under the same account we can use that as tacit
verification.Remember that, if you own other plugins, all the plugins
belonging to the same entity should be under the same WordPress.org
account.=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Please do not resubmit this plugin using a diffe=

account. Both submissions will be rejected if you do so, and your
accounts may be suspended until the situation is resolved. Instead,
ask us to change the owner =E2=80=94 we can certainly do that.Have you
checked for common technical issues?Please ensure that your plugin
adheres to best practices, including the following:=F0=9F=94=B4 Proper
sanitization of inputs=E2=84=B9=EF=B8=8F Why it matters: Sanitizing inputs =
is
crucial for protecting against security vulnerabilities like SQL
injection, handling invalid data, and ensuring that only safe,
expected data is processed.Please check the official WordPress docs on
sanitizing for details =E2=80=94 this is a quick summary.=F0=9F=94=8D Ident=
ify
unsanitized inputs: Check any input coming from sources such as: $_GET
, $_POST , $_REQUEST , $_COOKIE , $_SERVER , $_SESSION If these inputs
aren=E2=80=99t sanitized first, that=E2=80=99s a potential risk! =F0=9F=95=
=B5=EF=B8=8F=F0=9F=9B=A0 Fix
it: Always wrap any input with the right sanitization function, like:

ContentFunctionPlain textsanitize_text_field() Emailsanitize_email()
URLesc_url_raw() Keysanitize_key() Integerabsint() Refer to the
official WordPress documentation for a complete list of sanitization
functions.=F0=9F=91=89 Use the most restrictive function that fits the
expected content.=F0=9F=91=89 Sanitize as early as possible =E2=80=94 ideal=
ly as
soon as the data is received.=F0=9F=91=89 Only trust what you=E2=80=99ve cl=
eaned
yourself.Example:$post_id =3D (int) $_GET['post_id']; // Sanitized as an
integer
$email =3D sanitize_email( $_GET['email'] ); // Sanitized as an email
Your data is now sanitized! =F0=9F=A7=BC=F0=9F=8D=8FNote: When checking a n=
once using
wp_verify_nonce  you will need to sanitize the input using wp_unslash=20
AND sanitize_text_field , this is because this function is pluggable,
and extenders should not trust its input values.Example:if ( ! isset(
$_POST['dona82pl_nonce'] ) || ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_text_field(
wp_unslash ( $_POST['dona82pl_nonce'] ) ) , 'dona82pl_nonce' ) )
Example(s) from your plugin:includes/api/donations-controller.php:250
if (!wp_verify_nonce($nonce, 'wp_rest')) {
=E2=9C=94=EF=B8=8F You can check this using Plugin Check.=F0=9F=94=B4 Nonce=

nces
and permissions checks ensure that the request comes from a trusted
source, protecting against security threats like CSRF (Cross-Site
Request Forgery) attacks.Please check the official WordPress docs on
nonces and this article for details =E2=80=94 this is a quick summary.=F0=
=9F=94=8D
Spot it: Look for functions that interact with $_GET , $_POST ,
$_REQUEST  and perform actions triggered by the user/browser that
modify data or perform sensitive actions (e.g., privileged actions or
data manipulation). For such actions, you should always check for a
nonce.Additionally, verify user permissions if the action is
restricted to certain roles (e.g., admin, editor).When in doubt, play
it safe: always check.=F0=9F=9B=A0 Fix itCreate a nonce ( wp_nonce_field() =
,
wp_nonce_url() , wp_create_nonce()  ). If you need to pass the nonce
to JavaScript you can make use of wp_localize_script() Pass it with
the request.Check the nonce ( check_admin_referer() ,
check_ajax_referer() , wp_verify_nonce()  ) , and permissions if
applicable ( current_user_can()  ) .Example (nonce check):function
dona82pl_save_email(){
    if ( !isset( $_POST['dona82pl_nonce'] ) || !wp_verify_nonce(
sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_POST['dona82pl_nonce'] ) ),
'dona82pl_save_email_action' ) ) {
        wp_send_json_error( 'Invalid nonce.' );
    }

    if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_posts' ) ) {
        wp_send_json_error( 'Insufficient permissions.' );
    }

    if ( isset( $_POST['post_id'] ) && isset( $_POST['price'] ) ) {
        update_post_meta( absint( $_POST['post_id'] ), 'price',
floatval( $_POST['price'] ) );
    }
}
add_action( 'wp_ajax_dona82pl_save_email', 'dona82pl_save_email' );
=E2=9A=A0=EF=B8=8F Without nonce and permissions checks, anyone could call =

Prefixes for declarations, globals and stored data=E2=84=B9=EF=B8=8F Why it
matters: Prefixing avoid naming collisions with other themes, plugins,
or WordPress core functions.A prefix is a string placed in front of a
name to avoid collisions. It must be at least 4 characters long, feel
distinct and unique to the plugin (do not use common words), and be
separated by an underscore or dash.Please check the official WordPress
docs on avoiding name collisions.=F0=9F=94=8D Identify not prefixed names:
Look for any name that is used in a place where it can create a
collision.

wp_localize_script() , add_action( 'wp_ajax_...' ) , etc.If the
defined name for that is not prefixed, that=E2=80=99s a potential issue!
=F0=9F=95=B5=EF=B8=8F=F0=9F=9B=A0 Fix it: Always prefix those names, for ex=
ample if your
plugin is called "Donasai =E2=80=93 Platform Donasi & Penggalangan Dana"
then you could use names like these:function dona82pl_save_post(){ ...
}class DONA82PL_Admin { ... }update_option( 'dona82pl_options',
$options );register_setting( 'dona82pl_settings', 'dona82pl_user_id',
... );define( 'DONA82PL_PLUGIN_DIR', plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ )
);global $dona82pl_options;add_action('wp_ajax_dona82pl_save_data',
... );namespace hadiedankerdonasai;=F0=9F=94=B4 Use wp_enqueue commands=E2=

Why it matters: Because of performance and compatibility, please make
use of the built in functions for including static and dynamic JS
and/or CSS.=F0=9F=94=8D Identify JS and CSS outputs: Look for any
<script>  or <style>  HTML tags in your plugin. In the
majority of cases you could enqueue them.=F0=9F=9B=A0 Fix it: Make use of t=
he
specific function for enqueue them:

In the admin pages you can enqueue them using the hook=20
admin_enqueue_scripts() . You can also use admin_print_scripts()  and
admin_print_styles() .=F0=9F=91=89 As of WordPress 6.3, you can easily pass
attributes like defer or async, as of WordPress 5.7, you can pass
other attributes by using functions and filters.Example:function

done locally by the plugin.The service is clearly documented in your
readme, including Terms of Use and Privacy Policy links.For example: a
"Spam checker" plugin that connects to a external service to check for
spam (and thus uses it to provide that functionality) is generally
acceptable. A plugin that simply checks a license key to unlock local
features is not.=E2=9C=85 Ask yourself:Does any function only work after a
license check or payment?Is any functionality in the plugin code
disabled or limited until it=E2=80=99s unlocked?Are there any limitations o=
n
the plugin after a certain amount of time or usage?After excluding
functionalities provided by legitimate external services, if the
answer is yes to any of the above, the plugin does not comply.=F0=9F=94=A7 =
How
to fix it:Remove all license checks or other mechanisms that control
access to features built in in the plugin code.Remove or fully enable
any built in features that are currently locked or limited.Make sure
external services are compliant and clearly documented.=E2=84=B9=EF=B8=8F
Important clarification:WordPress.org is not a marketplace. It's a
repository for free, fully functional, GPL-compliant plugins.If you
are not offering a service and want to offer additional features
through a paid version, that code must be:Hosted elsewhere (e.g., your
own website).Not included in the plugin hosted on WordPress.org.GPL
compliant: Do not include any mechanisms that would prevent a plug-in
from being used after a license has been checked.Other detailsWe've
detected some other details that you may want to check.## Undocumented
use of a 3rd Party / external servicePlugins are permitted to require
the use of third party/external services as long as they are clearly
documented.When your plugin reach out to external services, you must
disclose it. This is true even if you are the one providing that
service.You are required to document it in a clear and plain language,
so users are aware of: what data is sent, why, where and under which
conditions.To do this, you must update your readme file to  clearly
explain that your plugin relies on third party/external services, and
include at least the following information for each third
party/external service that this plugin uses:What the service is and
what it is used for.What data is sent and when.Provide links to the
service's terms of service and privacy policy.Remember, this is for
your own legal protection. Use of services must be upfront and well
documented. This allows users to ensure that any legal issues with
data transmissions are covered.Example:=3D=3D External services =3D=3D

This plugin connects to an API to obtain weather information, it's
needed to show the weather information and forecasts in the included
widget.

It sends the user's location every time the widget is loaded (If the
location isn't available and/or the user hasn't given their consent,
it displays a configurable default location).
This service is provided by "PRT Weather INC": terms of use, privacy
policy.
Example(s) from your plugin:includes/functions-frontend.php:236
'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
## Review: Missing permission_callback  in REST API RouteWhen using
register_rest_route()  or wp_register_ability()  to define custom REST
API endpoints, it is crucial to include a proper permission_callback
.=F0=9F=94=92 This callback function ensures that only authorized users can
access or modify data through your endpoint.Code example, checking
that the user can change options:register_rest_route( 'donasai/v1',
'/my-endpoint', array(
    'methods' =3D> 'GET',
    'callback' =3D> 'donasai_callback_function',
    'permission_callback' =3D> function() {
        return current_user_can( 'manage_options' );
    }
) );
Please check the register_rest_route() documentation and the
current_user_can() documentation.=E2=9C=85 When a permission_callback  is
NOT Required:There are valid use cases for public endpoints, such as
publicly available data (e.g., posts, public metadata) or endpoints
designed for unauthenticated access (e.g., fetching public stats or
information).In these cases, you should use __return_true  as the
permission_callback  to indicate that the endpoint is intentionally
public.=F0=9F=94=92 When a permission_callback  IS Required:For endpoints t=
hat
involve sensitive data or actions (e.g., getting not public data,
creating, updating, or deleting content).In these cases, you should
always implement proper permission checks.Possible cases found on this
plugin's code:includes/api/campaigns-controller.php:12
register_rest_route('wpd/v1', '/campaigns/(?P<id>\d+)/donate',
array('methods' =3D> 'POST', 'callback' =3D>
'wpd_api_create_donation', 'permission_callback' =3D>
'__return_true'));
includes/api/fundraisers-controller.php:23
register_rest_route('wpd/v1', '/fundraisers', array(
    'methods' =3D> 'GET',
    'callback' =3D> 'wpd_api_get_fundraisers',
    // Public route for leaderboard? Or admin only?
    // If accessing specific user stats -> auth required.
    // If accessing leaderboard -> public.
    'permission_callback' =3D> '__return_true',
));
includes/api/webhook-controller.php:12 register_rest_route('wpd/v1',
'/midtrans/webhook', array('methods' =3D> 'POST', 'callback' =3D>
'wpd_api_midtrans_webhook', 'permission_callback' =3D>
'__return_true'));
## PHP libraries that might conflict with the same library loaded by
other pluginsYour plugin has included a copy of a library in a way
that might conflict with other copies of the same library loaded by
other plugins.Remember that all WordPress plugins share the same
execution space, which means that you have to pay special attention to
how libraries are loaded, as you might be trying to load a library
that another plugin has already loaded.Fortunately, there are ways to
avoid these types of conflictsRecommended: Using composer, a tool to
manage PHP dependencies, is one of the most convenient and
maintainable ways to load a PHP library, it will avoid this kind of
conflicts and you'll easily manage the updates of the library.Checking
if the library was already loaded using class_exists  or
function_exists  and avoid loading yourself if that's already
loaded.However, after getting around the conflicts of loading the same
library, we come to another point of conflict: Dealing with different
versions of the same library.Your plugin may find that another plugin
has loaded a different version of the same library (before your plugin
was able to load it) that is incompatible with your code. While this
may not be necessary in stable libraries when using well-established
functions, there are some ways to handle this and make your plugin
resilient:Recommended: If you are using Composer, you can use one of
the available tools to automatically assign your namespace to these
libraries.coenjacobs/mozart :
https://github.com/coenjacobs/mozartbrianhenryie/strauss :
https://github.com/brianhenryie/strausshumbug/php-scoper :
https://github.com/humbug/php-scoperThere are some libraries that
provide tools to give a namespace or prefix to the generated
library.You can manually provide your namespace to this library. Since
this would require you to modify the library, it may not be the most
practical choice.From your plugin:#

=F0=9F=91=89 Your next stepsThis is your checklist:Have you read the
guidelines and this plugin complies with them?Are you the rightful
owner of this plugin?Have you checked for common technical
issues?Other detailsIf there is something that needs to be fixed,
please take your time, fix it and update your plugin files at the "Add
your plugin" page, while being logged in with your account
"hadie-danker".Please be concise and do not list the changes done =E2=80=94
we will review the entire plugin again =E2=80=94 but do share any
clarifications or important context you want us to know.If after
checking the list and do the changes you feel that everything is right
or need further clarification, please reply to this email and a
volunteer will assist you.If you believe there is a requirement you
cannot accomplish and choose not to make changes, your plugin
submission will be rejected after three months.Thanks!By taking these
steps, you're helping the Plugin Review Team work more efficiently =E2=80=
=94
meaning your plugin (along with the thousands of others in the queue)
can be reviewed faster. =F0=9F=9A=80 We really appreciate your
contribution!DisclaimersIf, at any time during the review process, you
wish to change your permalink (aka the plugin slug) "donasai", you
must explicitly and clearly tell us what you would like it to be. Just
changing it in your code and in the display name is not sufficient.
Remember, permalinks cannot be altered after approval.This email was

e library loaded by other plugins</strong><br><br>Your plugin has included =
a copy of a library in a way that might conflict with other copies of the s=
ame library loaded by other plugins.<br><br>Remember that all WordPress plu=
gins share the same execution space, which means that you have to pay speci=
al attention to how libraries are loaded, as you might be trying to load a =
library that another plugin has already loaded.<br><br>Fortunately, there a=
re ways to avoid these types of conflicts<br><ul><li>Recommended: Using com=
poser, a tool to manage PHP dependencies, is one of the most convenient and=
 maintainable ways to load a PHP library, it will avoid this kind of confli=
cts and you'll easily manage the updates of the library.<br></li><li>Checki=
ng if the library was already loaded using <code class=3D"inline-code">clas=
s_exists</code>  or <code class=3D"inline-code">function_exists</code>  and=
 avoid loading yourself if that's already loaded.<br></li></ul><br>However,=
 after getting around the conflicts of loading the same library, we come to=
 another point of conflict: Dealing with different versions of the same lib=
rary.<br><br>Your plugin may find that another plugin has loaded a differen=
t version of the same library (before your plugin was able to load it) that=
 is incompatible with your code. While this may not be necessary in stable =
libraries when using well-established functions, there are some ways to han=
dle this and make your plugin resilient:<br><ul><li>Recommended: If you are=
 using Composer, you can use one of the available tools to automatically as=
sign your namespace to these libraries.<br><ul><li>coenjacobs/mozart : <a h=

de tools to give a namespace or prefix to the generated library.<br></li><l=
i>You can manually provide your namespace to this library. Since this would=
 require you to modify the library, it may not be the most practical choice=
